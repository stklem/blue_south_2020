The Campaign supports communities, parents, policymakers, and policy                 advocates by facilitating policy research on the AR-GLR impact areas, providing strategic                         communication to raise community awareness, and building local capacity through                     community solutions to address gaps in early literacy. In 2018, the Campaign shifted to                             equity with the development and adoption of a new community strategy to ensure                           equitable outcomes for children birth through eight. AR-GLR is derived from the National                           Campaign for Grade Level Reading and is managed in partnership with the Arkansas                       Community",
